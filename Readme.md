# OOP Lab 

* Create project called `School` it has the main method 

* Create two classes named `com.company.Teacher` and `com.company.Student`. Each class should contain:
    * At least three attributes
    * A constructor
    * A toString method to display the values of all the attributes of each class

* Edit `com.company.Main.java` to check the toString methods youâ€™ve created for each of the classes above. To test the toString methods, create three instances of each class (each with different attribute values) and display them as was done for the com.company.Student class.
