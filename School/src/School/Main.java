//        Create two classes named Teacher and Student. Each class should contain:
//
//        At least three attributes
//        A constructor
//        A toString method to display the values of all the attributes of each class
//        Edit Main.java to check the toString methods youâ€™ve created for each of the classes above.
//           To test the toString methods, create three instances of each class (each with different attribute values)
//           and display them as was done for the Student class.
